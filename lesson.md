# Lesson

## Brief

### Preparation

We will be using Google Colaboratory (you can use the same google account created in the previous unit) in this lesson.

### Lesson Overview

In this lesson, we will be learning about Natural Language Processing (NLP), its challenges, and how to preprocess text data, normalize text, build a language model, measure similarity between documents, find similar words, and classify text.

## Part 1 - Natural Language Processing - Advanced

We will be using [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1io-CwOqM7Aw90_VEkvshIaP2DUx_7IpX?usp=sharing) Colab notebook for this section.

> Open the Colab link, then go to File -> Save a copy in Drive. This will create a copy of the notebook in your Google Drive. It will then open the notebook in a new tab.
>
> Follow on with the lesson in the notebook.
