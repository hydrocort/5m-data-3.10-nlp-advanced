## Dependencies

Refer to the following markdown file for the respective sections of the class:

- [Self Studies](./studies.md)
- [Lesson](./lesson.md)
- [Assignment](./assignment.md)
- [Quiz](./quiz.md)
- [Reference](./reference.md)

## Lesson Objectives

Learners will understand:

- Deep Learning for NLP
- Common NLP tasks
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Attention Mechanism
- Transformers

Learners will be able to:

- Train an RNN for language modeling
- Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment analysis
- Use a pre-trained BERT model for NER
- Use a pre-trained GPT-2 model for text generation
